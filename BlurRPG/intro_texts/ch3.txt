You managed to get out of this insane pursuit...
Who exactly was chasing you?
Then you did not know it yet
When you ran out of the forest - wounded, dirty, with your clothes wet - you intended to keep on going
Persistently...
Away... A w a y . . .
You fell unconscious on the ground.
As through the fog you remember the velvet voice of the man who found you in this desolation.
He took you to his house
He saved you
